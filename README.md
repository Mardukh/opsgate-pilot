##  Overview

OpsGate solves the critical problem facing WordPress agencies and security-conscious businesses: **scattered operations tools with no unified evidence trail**. 

Instead of juggling separate systems for backups, SSL monitoring, plugin security, and workflow automation, OpsGate provides a cohesive operations layer that:

- **Watches** your WordPress sites continuously
- **Analyzes** plugin vulnerabilities, SSL status, backups, and FTP activity  
- **Proves** compliance with automated evidence packs for clients

###  Built For

| Audience | Primary Benefit | Use Case |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **WordPress Agencies** | Sell "Ops as a Service" | Manage dozens of client sites with daily ops checks |
| **Solo Devs & Studios** | Enterprise guardrails without DevOps team | Offer premium care plans with PDF evidence |
| **Security-conscious SMBs** | Reduced risk with clear compliance | Answer "Are we actually OK?" with concrete logs |
